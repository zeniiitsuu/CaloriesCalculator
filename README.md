# üßÆ Calorie Calculator

Yos! This is my personal project - a calorie calculator web app with a good UI and custom themes. I wanted to create something practical that looks good and is actually useful for daily life.

##  What It Does

This calculator helps you figure out:
- How many calories your body needs each day
- Your BMI (Body Mass Index) with a visual gauge
- How many calories you need for gaining or losing weight
- Recommended macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats)

I added other cool features like:
- Dark/Light themes (the light theme is Cinnamoroll-inspired!)
- Support for English, Portuguese, and Japanese
- Responsive design that works on phones, tablets and desktops
- Smooth animations that make the app feel alive

##  Tech Stack

I built this with:
- React + TypeScript (to keep my code organized)
- Vite (super fast for development)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling without writing tons of CSS)
- Framer Motion (for the animations)

##  How to Use It

1. Choose your gender
2. Enter your age, weight, and height
3. Select your activity level
4. Hit calculate!

The app will instantly show you all your calorie needs and BMI information.

##  Running It Locally

If you want to check out the code or run it yourself:

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeniiitsuu/CaloriesCalculator.git
cd calorie-calculator
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üåü What I Learned

This project helped me improve my React skills and learn more about:
- Creating a responsive UI that works on multiple devices
- Using TypeScript for type-safe code
- Implementing theme switching
- Building multi-language support
- Creating smooth animations with Framer Motion

## üìù Future Improvements

I'm still working on this! Some things I want to add:
- Save history of previous calculations
- More detailed nutrition breakdown
- Custom food logging
- Progress tracking over time
